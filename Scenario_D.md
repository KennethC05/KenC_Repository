Hi Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out we truly appreciate you taking the time to reconnect with us and share your willingness to make things right.

We understand that life can get busy, and we’re sorry to hear that you weren’t able to complete the required coursework during the **TIP101** program. As part of our course policy, continued participation requires regular engagement with assignments, and unfortunately, due to missing submissions and lack of response during our outreach, we had to proceed with your withdrawal from the course.

That said, we genuinely admire your initiative in reaching back out. While we’re not able to reinstate you in the current cohort, the good news is that you’ll continue to have **lifetime access** to the course materials if you log in using the same GitHub account you registered with. We encourage you to go through the content at your own pace, continue learning, and practice the material whenever possible.

We’re always looking for students who are ready to fully commit to our programs. If you're interested in rejoining a future cohort, we’d be glad to notify you once enrollment opens again just let us know, and we’ll keep you in the loop.

Wishing you all the best in your continued learning journey, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have further questions.

Best regards,  
**CodePath Support**
