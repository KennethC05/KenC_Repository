Hi Anne,

Thank you so much for reaching out and for your interest in our **Summer Interview Prep course**. We truly admire your persistence the drive to apply to over 100 internships takes incredible determination, and we know how discouraging the process can sometimes feel.

We regret to share that the course has already closed and is currently at capacity, with a long waitlist. Normally, we would invite applicants to try again next year, but we understand that with your upcoming graduation this spring, that won’t be an option and that makes this even tougher.

Please know this isn’t a reflection of your potential. At **CodePath**, we believe deeply in your ability to grow and succeed, and while we can’t offer a spot in the course this summer, we’d still love to support you in other ways.

We highly recommend checking out our **[Software Interview Preparation Guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view)** a resource we created specifically to help students like you navigate the technical interview process with confidence.

Here’s what you’ll find inside:

- **Interview types broken down**: coding & algorithms, project-based, and tech stack-specific questions  
- **Practical advice**: how to introduce yourself, clarify problems, choose an approach, and communicate effectively  
- **Real-world insights**: from engineers at Google, Facebook, and more  
- **Step-by-step structure**: to help you stay focused and prepared, even if interviews feel overwhelming  

Anne, we’re truly rooting for you. You’re showing all the right qualities **grit, curiosity, and commitment** and that will take you far. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like help crafting a study plan or want suggestions for tracking your prep. We’d be happy to help however we can.

Wishing you all the best in the next step of your journey, and hoping our paths cross again soon.

Best regards,  
**CodePath Support**
