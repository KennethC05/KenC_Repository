Hi Jane,

Thank you so much for your time, effort, and passion throughout the application process and especially for the hard work you put into building the **Flix app**. We know it takes many hours to complete, and we want you to know that your dedication did not go unnoticed.

We understand how disappointing it must have been to receive news of ineligibility after completing everything. Please know that this is **not a reflection of your ability, motivation, or potential** rather, it comes down to the limitations of our current program structure.

As a non-profit, **CodePath’s courses are currently sponsored in partnership with universities and donors based in the United States**. Because of that, our programs are limited to students enrolled in U.S.-based institutions. These eligibility criteria are mentioned in multiple sections of the application, but we understand that it’s easy to miss these details during a multi-step process and we take your feedback seriously.

We truly admire your commitment to learning, and it means a lot to us that you’re still eager to join despite the circumstances. While we unfortunately can’t make individual exceptions at this time, we’re actively working toward expanding access globally in the future. We’ve previously offered programs in **Taiwan** and currently run courses in **Haiti**, and we're hopeful about reaching more international learners down the line.

In the meantime, we encourage you to stay connected through our **newsletter** and **open-access resources**, and we’d be happy to share updates if opportunities become available in your region.

Thank you again for your honesty and enthusiasm and most of all, for caring enough to reach out. We hope to cross paths again soon.

Best regards,  
**CodePath Support**
