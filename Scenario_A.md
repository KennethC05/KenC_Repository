Hi John,

Thank you so much for your enthusiasm and for reaching out about your track placement. We're excited to have someone with your strong academic background and commitment to growth in our program being a straight-A sophomore at MIT is no small feat, and it speaks to your potential.

We’ve carefully reviewed your request to be placed in the **Advanced (TIP103)** track. As part of our admissions process, we place students based on demonstrated technical interview readiness from the pre-work. This allows us to ensure that each student is set up for the best experience possible one that challenges them at the right pace while reinforcing key concepts effectively.

While **TIP103** does offer a faster-paced environment and deeper dives into advanced topics like **dynamic programming**, **greedy algorithms**, and **graph theory**, it builds on a solid foundation that **TIP102 (Intermediate)** is designed to strengthen. Your pre-work score indicates that TIP102 would provide the right level of support to further develop those foundational problem-solving skills, which are essential even for top-tier interviews.

We fully understand your desire to challenge yourself, and the good news is that TIP102 is built to help motivated students accelerate their learning. Many of our past Intermediate students have gone on to thrive in the Advanced track or even land top internship roles with the skills they’ve built.

We hope you’ll continue with us in **TIP102**, where you’ll receive a strong foundation and personalized support.

Thanks again for your understanding, and we look forward to seeing what you accomplish!

Best regards,  
**CodePath Support**
